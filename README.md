I had a job interview where was asked me to implement a power solution without using Math.pow.
As I was implementing it, the interviewer start requesting changes to optmize it.
So I came with 4 ways to do it, from the simpler and with worst O(N) to the most optmized for better O(N).

Output:

```angular2html

Solution for the power code test that I did in one interview
Looping through
Base= 2, power = 3, result 8.0
Base= 2, power = 8, result 1024.0

Completely recursive
Base= 2, power = 3, result 8.0
Base= 2, power = 8, result 1024.0

Using Math.pow
Base= 2, power = 3, result 8.0
Base= 2, power = 8, result 1024.0

Process finished with exit code 0

```
